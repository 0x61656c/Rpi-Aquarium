# Rpi-Aquarium
A script that automatically feeds my fish when I'm on vacation. 

This script is meant to run on a raspberry pi, but I really dont care what you do with it. My automatic feeder is basically a breadboard with a servo attached to it. Not going to do a hardware tutorial because it's been done thousands of times in various forms. 

I am not responsible for tank-related overflow errors
